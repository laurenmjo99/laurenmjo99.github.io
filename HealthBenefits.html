  <h2>Health Benefits of Coffee</h2>
    <p>Coffee is more than just your morning pick-me-up. In fact, coffee has been shown to have some significant health benefits! </p>


<h3>What are the Health Benefits of a Daily Cup O' Joe?</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left;">Recent studies have revealed correlations between regularly drinking coffee and a reduced risk of multiple diseases. Although there are many more benefits, here are 5 ways drinking coffee can significantly improve your health.

      <li>Coffee contains caffeine - a psychoactive stimulant. Consuming caffeine enhances the firing neurons, and improving overall brain function and reaction time.</li>
      <li>Another benefit of coffee's high caffeine level is that it can also aid in the body's natural fat burning process. </li>
      <li>Caffeine can also stimulate the nervous system and trigger the release of the "fight-or-flight" hormone, epinephrine. This significantly improves physical or athletic performances.</li>
      <li>Coffee contains many important daily nutrients like vitamins B2, B5, B3, manganese, and potassium. </li>
      <li>In recent studies, regularly drinking coffee has been correlated to a lower risk of developing Dementia, Alzheimers, Parkinson's, and Type II Diabetes.</li>
